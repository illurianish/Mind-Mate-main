# TODO: User authentication will go here eventually
# For now we're just using a default user (user_id=1) for everything
# But when we add proper login/signup, this is where it'll live

# Ideas for future:
# - JWT token authentication
# - Password hashing with bcrypt
# - Maybe Google OAuth login
# - Password reset via email
# - User registration with email verification
